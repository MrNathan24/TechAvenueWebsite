                    <h3>Internet of Things</h3>
                    <p style="text-align: justify;">One of the developing technological trends that arebeing utilized widely. This enables ease of access to various applications without manual interception of humans. This system is being integrated to different applications throughthe use of sensors and vision technologies.Many devices have wifi connectivity enabled in their system that allows ease of access with these applications. It holds a promising increase in productivity in the future since most devices are interconnected to each other, thus allowing direct access to connected devices effectively. Things have evolved due to the convergence of multiple technologies, real-time analytics, machine learning, commodity sensors, and embedded systems.Traditional fields of embedded systems, wireless sensor networks, control systems, automation (including home and building automation), and others all contribute to enabling the Internet of things.In the consumer market, IoT technology is most synonymous with products pertaining to the concept of the "smart home", including devices and appliances (such as lighting fixtures, thermostats, home security systems and cameras, and other home appliances) that support one or more common ecosystems, and can be controlled via devices associated with that ecosystem, such as smartphones and smart speakers. </p>

                    <h3>Artificial Intelligence</h3>
                    <p style="text-align: justify;">Artificial intelligence plays an
                      enormous role in our everyday life. This
                      field offers a lot of promising results in
                      various fields such as healthcare,
                      education, manufacturing and economy.
                      Alexa, Siri, and Google Assistant are
                      leading examples of this great
                      advancement in technology. AI
                      technologies allow automation on
                      various parts in businesses that assist in
                      their productivity.New jobs in this field are also estimated to
                      rise in the aspects of development,
                      programming, support, maintenance and
                      testing. Artificial intelligence is considered
                      to be a top technology trend that we should
                      take advantage of as early as now. Currently
                      this technology has been shaping numerous
                      industries and will continue to do so in the
                      future.Virtual reality – where users wear a headset and are fully immersed in computer-generated environments – has been developed to meet design, marketing, education, training, and retail needs. Augmented reality – where computer images are superimposed onto the user's view of the real world, through a screen or headset – is a more complex challenge, as it requires the software to "see" what is in front of it. But we're getting used to seeing it used for more than adding cartoon features to selfie pictures or spotting Pokemon in the wild.</p>

                    <h3>Blockchain Technology</h3>
                    <p style="text-align: justify;">Blockchain technology is a structure that stores transactional records, also known as the block, of the public in several databases, known as the “chain,” in a network connected through peer-to-peer nodes. Typically, this storage is referred to as a ‘digital ledger.’

                      Every transaction in this ledger is authorized by the digital signature of the owner, which authenticates the transaction and safeguards it from tampering. Hence, the information the digital ledger contains is highly secure.
                      
                      In simpler words, the digital ledger is like a Google spreadsheet shared among numerous computers in a network, in which, the transactional records are stored based on actual purchases. The fascinating angle is that anybody can see the data, but they can’t corrupt it.</p>

                    <h3>Virtual/Augmented Reality</h3>
                    <p style="text-align: justify;">The terms "virtual reality" and "augmented reality" get thrown around a lot these days, thanks to the resurgence of VR headsets heralded by the Oculus Rift and the use of AR apps and games like Pokemon Go. They sound similar, and as the technologies develop, they bleed over into each other a bit. They're two very different concepts, though, with characteristics that readily distinguish them from one another.Whereas virtual reality replaces your vision, augmented reality adds to it. AR devices like the Microsoft HoloLens and various enterprise-level "smart glasses" are transparent, letting you see everything in front of you as if you are wearing a weak pair of sunglasses. The technology is designed for completely free movement while projecting images over whatever you look at. The concept extends to smartphones with AR apps and games like Pokemon Go, which use your phone's camera to track your surroundings and overlay additional information on top of it, on the screen.AR displays can offer something as simple as a data overlay that shows the time, to something as complicated as holograms floating in the middle of a room. Pokemon Go projects a Pokemon on your screen, on top of whatever the camera is looking at. The HoloLens and other smart glasses like the mysterious Magic Leap One, meanwhile, let you virtually place floating app windows and 3D decorations around you.</p>

                    <h3>Quantum Computing</h3>
                    
                    <p style="text-align: justify;">Quantum computing allows robust
                      computations using quantum bits or qubits
                      instead of the traditional binary digits. The
                      amount of time in accepting data is
                      drastically reduced due to its ability to
                      analyse zero’s and one’s concurrently
                      through a phenomenon called
                      superposition. Quantum computers are
                      expected to change the field of security.Quantum physics has defied logic since the atom was first studied in the early 20th century. It turns out atoms do not follow the traditional rules of physics. Quantum particles can move forward or backward in time, exist in two places at once and even “teleport.” It’s these strange behaviours that quantum computers aim to use to their advantage.

                      Classical computers manipulate ones and zeroes to crunch through operations, but quantum computers use quantum bits or qubits. Just like classical computers, quantum computers use ones and zeros, but qubits have a third state called “superposition” that allows them to represent a one or a zero at the same time. Instead of analysing a one or a zero sequentially, superposition allows two qubits in superposition to represent four scenarios at the same time. Therefore, the time it takes to crunch a data set is significantly reduced.</p>

                    <h3>5G Technology</h3>
                    <p style="text-align: justify;">5G technology is a breakthrough.
                      The next-generation of telecom networks (fifth generation or 5G) has started hitting the market end of 2018 and will continue to expand worldwide.
                      Beyond speed improvement, the technology is expected to unleash a massive 5G IoT (Internet of Things) ecosystem where networks can serve communication needs for billions of connected devices, with the right trade-offs between speed, latency, and cost.The G in this 5G means it's a generation of wireless technology. While most generations have technically been defined by their data transmission speeds, each has also been marked by a break in encoding methods, or "air interfaces," that make it incompatible with the previous generation.
                      1G was analog cellular. 2G technologies, such as CDMA, GSM, and TDMA, were the first generation of digital cellular technologies. 3G technologies, such as EVDO, HSPA, and UMTS, brought speeds from 200kbps to a few megabits per second. 4G technologies, such as WiMAX and LTE, were the next incompatible leap forward, and they are now scaling up to hundreds of megabits and even gigabit-level speeds.
                      5G brings three new aspects to the table: bigger channels (to speed up data), lower latency (to be more responsive), and the ability to connect a lot more devices at once (for sensors and smart devices).

                    <p style="text-align: justify;">Hyperautomation brings together several components of process automation, integrating tools and technologies that amplify the ability to automate work. 
                    It starts with robotic process automation (RPA) at its core, and expands automation capability with artificial intelligence (AI), process mining, analytics, and other advanced tools. 
                    The idea is to automate more and more knowledge work, and engage everyone in an organization to be part of the transformation.  This technology is an amalgamation of two
                    prominent technologies of this era,
                    RPA(robotic process automation) and
                    machine learning. It focuses on
                    understanding automation mechanisms
                    and how it is controlled using machine
                    learning. In 2020, it is implied to have a

                    <h3>3D Printing Technology</h3>
                    <p style="text-align: justify;">3D printing or additive manufacturing is a process of making three dimensional solid objects from a digital file. The creation of a 3D printed object is achieved using additive processes. In an additive process an object is created by laying down successive layers of material until the object is created. Each of these layers can be seen as a thinly sliced cross-section of the object. 3D printing is the opposite of subtractive manufacturing which is cutting out / hollowing out a piece of metal or plastic with for instance a milling machine. 3D printing enables you to produce complex shapes using less material than traditional manufacturing methods.The first step is the preparation just before printing, when you design a 3D file of the object you want to print. This 3D file can be created using CAD software , with a 3D scanner or simply downloaded from an online marketplace. Once you have checked that your 3D file is ready to be printed , you can proceed to the second step.

                      The second step is the actual printing process. First, you need to choose which material will best achieve the specific properties required for your object. The variety of materials used in 3D printing is very broad. It includes plastics, ceramics, resins, metals, sand, textiles, biomaterials, glass, food and even lunar dust! Most of these materials also allow for plenty of finishing options that enable you to achieve the precise design result you had in mind, and some others, like glass for example, are still being developed as 3D printing material and are not easily accessible yet.
                      
                      The third step is the finishing process. This step requires specific skills and materials. When the object is first printed, often it cannot be directly used or delivered until it has been sanded, lacquered or painted to complete it as intended.</p>

                    <h3>Cognitive Cloud Computing</h3>
                    <p style="text-align: justify;">Cognitive cloud computing is an extended
                      ecosystem that enables applications to
                      provide solutions to the people through
                      cloud computing. Considered to be the next
                      big thing in the IT industry. It helps in
                      decision-making through understanding the
                      complexity of data. IBM, Microsoft, Google
                      and Cisco are already investing in these
                      technologies.Cognitive computing is the use of computerized models to simulate the human thought process in complex situations where the answers may be ambiguous and uncertain. The phrase is closely associated with IBM's cognitive computer system, Watson. Cognitive computing overlaps with AI and involves many of the same underlying technologies to power cognitive applications, including expert systems, neural networks, robotics and virtual reality (VR).Cognitive computing systems can synthesize data from various information sources, while weighing context and conflicting evidence to suggest the best possible answers. To achieve this, cognitive systems include self-learning technologies that use data mining, pattern recognition and natural language processing (NLP) to mimic the way the human brain works.

                      Using computer systems to solve the types of problems that humans are typically tasked with requires vast amounts of structured and unstructured data, fed to machine learning algorithms. Over time, cognitive systems are able to refine the way they identify patterns and the way they process data to become capable of anticipating new problems and model possible solutions.</p>
